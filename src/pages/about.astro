            I like computers, they‚Äôre magical. And I like music, it‚Äôs the most
            beautiful language I know. Every day I strive to become a little bit
            better at each of them, combining them whenever I can. I also like
            to think that I have an eye for design and aesthetics, as I always
            strive to make the UI/UX as good an experience as I can.
