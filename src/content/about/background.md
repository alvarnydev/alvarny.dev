Still in school, I already found computers to be these fascinating, magic machines that could do ✨*anything*✨. This led to me to studying computer science for a few years which is when I unfortunately learned that that's not _entirely_ true. Although learning this was at first a disappointment, I then used that knowledge to become quite good at making them do what I wanted them to. This led me down the path of software development, which I'm still on today. Over the years I've picked up quite a versatile set of skills and experiences, which you can read more about below.
