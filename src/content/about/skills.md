<!-- I got my start in programming with C# and .NET (at the time .NET Framework), which had me working with a wide range of .NET technologies, including ASP.NET, Entity Framework and WPF. I got to play around with Blazor and Xamarin and built my first REST API (that was actually useful) using ASP.NET Core.
This is also the time when I learned lots about programming fundamentals, such as object-oriented programming, SOLID principles, design patterns, and unit testing.

So then I heard the cool kids were all about web development with React. Me lacking frontend experience I decided to learn it and remember thinking "this should be easy, I have a good foundation". Learning HTML and CSS was easy enough, and then I was to meet JavaScript. Why is this variable available here? Hmm. Oh, '2' == 2? Right. Still, I endured and learned all about its weird quirks and features.

I then learned about TypeScript and very quickly decided that's where I'd rather be. Picking up types here and there I built lots of small projects, slowly also learning React and a bit of Next.js. Over time this introduced me to lots of other cool tech like Vite, Bun, Astro, Tailwind, DaisyUI, Zod or tRPC.
